				Welcome! You&apos;ve found my digital home. This place is the
				nexus of all of my interests, hobbies, and projects. Feel free

			<p>
				My name is Garikai Gumbo. I&apos;m an engineer by training, and
				a software programmer by nightâ€”to put it most appropriately. My
				interests include pencil drawing, cursive calligraphy, classical
				literature, symbolism, Orthodox iconography, patristics, and a
				whole bunch of other things which I will be documenting here.

				You may check out what I&apos;m thinking about or currently
				studying in detail from my{" "}
				<a href="#reading-list">reading list</a>. If I stumble upon
				something particularly interesting, insightful, or compelling,
				I&apos;ll probably jot something down on it on my{" "}
				<a href="#blog">blog</a> (a work in progress currently).
			</p>
			<p>
				That&apos;s it from me, thank you again for stopping by and
				happy scrolling!
