				Welcome! This place is the nexus of all of my interests,
				hobbies, projects, and professional undertakings. Feel free to
				check out what interests you. You can get in touch with me
				through my <a href="#contact-details">email and socials</a> for
				any inquiries. I guess I'll just go ahead and "summarize"
				myself.

			<p>
				My name is Garikai Rodney Gumbo, I'm an Electrical Engineering
				student by day, and a software coder by nightâ€”to put it most
				appropriately. Besides these areas of "specialization", I am
				also interested in pencil drawing, cursive calligraphy,
				classical literature, biblical symbolism, Orthodox iconography,
				patristics... among other things.

				You may check out what I'm thinking about or currently studying
				in detail from my <a href="#reading-list">reading list</a>. If I
				stumble upon something particularly interesting, insightful, or
				compelling, I'll probably jot something down on it on my{" "}
				<a href="#blog">blog</a> (a work in progress currently).
			</p>
			<p>
				That's it from me, thank you again for stopping by and happy
